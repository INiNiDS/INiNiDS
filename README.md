# ⚡ Hello, I'm Nikita!

**Developer from Tashkent | Rustacean | Systems & Desktop Software**

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a developer who loves looking under the hood of technology, squeezing the maximum performance out of hardware, and building fast, reliable tools from scratch.

### 📖 My Story: From Discord Bots to Custom Engines

My adventure began on Discord, where I randomly came across a guy making his own bots. I got curious about how it all worked under the surface. I started with BDFD (Bot Designer for Discord), found the largest BDFD server in the Russian-speaking community, and actually ended up making friends there because I accidentally won their most expensive giveaway. 

After that, I moved on to working with Python. However, I eventually got bored with that ecosystem and wanted a deeper challenge. This pushed me to evolve, dive into lower-level programming, and become the developer I am today.

### 🚀 My Projects

#### 🎮 rustgames `[In Development]` `[Private Repository]`
My most ambitious project to date: a custom game engine written entirely in **Rust**.
* Built on top of `wgpu` and `winit` for low-level control over windows and graphics rendering.
* Features custom texture rendering, state management, and specialized text rendering (including a custom "typewriter" effect).
* Focused on maximum performance, memory safety, and a deep understanding of how the GPU operates.

#### 📦 aam — Custom Data Format
The development of a unique data format `aam` and the accompanying tools to work with it. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of data structures, serialization, parsing, and file architecture.
* [aam-rs Repository](https://github.com/INiNiDS/aam-rs)
